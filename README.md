## 📝 Original Prompt

The entire app was created from this single prompt:

```
Build a fun and colorful mini web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should let users type in a short affirmation or positive thought and add it to a display wall. Each affirmation should appear as a floating bubble with a random gradient background. Each bubble should have a "💫 Highlight" button to enlarge and glow temporarily, and a "❌ Remove" button to pop it away with a smooth scale-out animation. Make the app mobile-friendly and use soft, cheerful animations. Keep all the code in one file and add comments to explain what each part does. Only show the code, no extra text.
```

## 🎨 One-Prompt Creation
